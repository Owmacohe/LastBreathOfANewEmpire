We are miners from the far star clusters. We need ores to smelt into weapons.
Why are you making weapons?
Sure, here you go.
I won't sell ore if it's being turned into tools of death.

Why, to take back control of the sector! Surely you abhor the <shake a=0.3>Empire</shake> as much as we do?
Indeed I do. Take these at a discount.
Well to you, these now cost more.
You resistance fighters are traitors. I won't sell to you.

You lack awareness of what's happening around you. I hope that one day you come to your senses.

You are too kind, shopkeeper. It's people like you and I who are building the new sector.
