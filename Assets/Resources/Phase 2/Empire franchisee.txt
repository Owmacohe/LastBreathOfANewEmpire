Phenomenal! Please sign right here to officiate the sale. We will pay you <swing>50 credits</swing> in advance of course, and more when the building is converted.
Thank you!
Wait, what do you mean by converted?

Uh, yes. Of course. Here: <Upon finalization of the contract, all property owned by the signing party will henceforth be transferred to The Empire. The Empire shall have full jurisdiction regarding future operation of the premises.>
I should look at this with a lawyer...
Looks fine to me!
