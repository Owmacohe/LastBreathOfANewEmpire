Good afternoon, we're here to deposit some crates for storage on the premises.
Right, of course.
Wait, why?
I'm having second thoughts about this.

These crates contain weapons, which will be used to arm shock troops in the Dust Belt. Please make sure they are kept safely until future collection.
Weapons? You can't store those here.
They're in good hands.

This establishment is under our jurisdiction. Not long ago, you signed to relinquish full control of all future operations here.
Can we re-negotiate?
Right, of course.

I see. The matter is not up for debate however. This establishment will be used for storage, and due to your lack of cooperation, you will receive no credit payment.

Absolutely not. Your contract is legally-binding. Is that a problem?
Not at all.
Yeah, it kind of is!
