Good afternoon. We at the Aid Council are going planet from planet accepting food donations.
Why do you need rations?
Will you take ammo?
Sure, I'd be happy to donate.

Places all over the sector have fallen on hard times due to Empire subjugation and harsh mining conditions. Even a small contribution helps.
I can spare some rations.
Take as much as you'd like.
I don't have to give anything to you.

We're a <wave a=0.5>non-profit</wave>. I don't think that would be proper...
C'mon, I can't get rid of anything else!
Alright, I can spare some rations then.

Your generosity is warmly welcomed. <wave a=0.5>Thank you!</wave> You don't suppose you'd be interested in converting part of your shop into a soup kitchen, would you?
Actually, I'd love to. We common folk need to take care of our own.
How much would it cost me?
Absolutely not.

I'm so glad to hear that. The setup will only require a small credit fee from you up front, and the Aid Council will take it from there.
I can't pay any more than I already have, sorry.
Sounds good to me.
