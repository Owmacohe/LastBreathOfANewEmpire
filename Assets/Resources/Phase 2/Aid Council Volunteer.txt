Hello there! Thanks to your kindness, we've just renovated the back side of your store into a functioning soup kitchen.
That's good, but please stay out of my way.
I'm glad! Is there anything I can do to help?

Presently, no. But issues always arise, and we'll be sure to contact you should anything happen.
Sounds good to me.
Would you like some rations to get the food flowing?
