# Last Breath Of A New Empire
*First game prototype for my CART 315 class*

## Game features

## Journal

### Design hypothesis
- RTS-style strategy game set in space
- Heavy focus on dialogue
- [Stellaris](stellaris.com)-like interface, but with less tension and more whimsicality
   - Procedurally-generated planets and narratives *(this may not be feasible within the timeframe)*
- Story focuses on the player as a shopkeeper, watching the collapse of an inter-galactic empire through sales and conversations
   - Map slowly goes dark over the course of the game
- Some resource-management and special events here and there

### Development
***Entry 1***
   - Started to plan out some of the basic structure of the design hypothesis
   - Had to scale back a bit, and focus on a smaller story
   - Still a bit worried that I may be beyond what I can do in a week, but we'll see
