- Mild resource management
- Sci fi political interest

## Journal

### Design hypothesis
- RTS-style strategy game set in space
- Heavy focus on dialogue
- [Stellaris](https://stellaris.com)-like interface, but with less tension and more whimsicality
   - Procedurally-generated planets and narratives *(this may not be feasible within the timeframe)*
- Story focuses on the player as a shopkeeper, watching the collapse of an inter-galactic empire through sales and conversations
   - Map slowly goes dark over the course of the game
- Some resource-management and special events here and there

### Development
***Entry 1***

   - Started to plan out some of the basic structure of the design hypothesis
   - Had to scale back a bit, and focus on a smaller story
   - Still a bit worried that I may be beyond what I can do in a week, but we'll see

***Entry 2***

- Added a script to generate the random night’s sky pattern
- Learned how to use the bloom post-processing effect
- Started work on creating simple UI for the game

***Entry 3***

- Started work on creating gameplay
- Added visiting starships and a home location
- Worked some more on the UI

***Entry 4***

- Created a base for a dialogue system
- Created a template dialogue text file

***Entry 5***

- Made dialogue more susceptible to branching narratives
- Added profile pictures to the characters

***Entry 6***

- Added title and end screen
- Added 3 dialogue files (much more will be needed in a final version)
- Lots of small tweaks

## Questions for playtesters

1. The game is meant to slowly feed the narrative to the player through these small dialogue interactions. From the limited amount that you’ve seen, do you think that a full-fledged narrative could be accomplished this way?
2. Would this fare better as a 3D game with an actual shop environment? Or is the minimal UI a style of its own?
3. Should the narrative stakes be lowered? In other words, is the story’s scope and worldbuilding too vast?
