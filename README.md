## Journal

### Design hypothesis
- RTS-style strategy game set in space
- Heavy focus on dialogue
- [Stellaris](https://stellaris.com)-like interface, but with less tension and more whimsicality
   - Procedurally-generated planets and narratives *(this may not be feasible within the timeframe)*
- Story focuses on the player as a shopkeeper, watching the collapse of an inter-galactic empire through sales and conversations
   - Map slowly goes dark over the course of the game
- Some resource-management and special events here and there

## Questions for playtesters - Round 1

1. The game is meant to slowly feed the narrative to the player through these small dialogue interactions. From the limited amount that you’ve seen, do you think that a full-fledged narrative could be accomplished this way?
2. Would this fare better as a 3D game with an actual shop environment? Or is the minimal UI a style of its own?
3. Should the narrative stakes be lowered? In other words, is the story’s scope and worldbuilding too vast?

## Results from playtesting - Round 1

### Main issues
- Visuals were a bit diorienting for playtesters who had mostly used 3D
- Lack of clue as to what the context was hindered players at the start
- The bug which failed to take the player to the end screen was a prominent issue
- There was a non-zero amount of comments requesting a tutorial

### Main enjoyments
- The feasibility of the game was echoed by most, if not all playtesters
- Playtesters felt that the UI didn't need any 3D additions
- They also felt that the scope wasn't too vast, and they were able to grasp the narrative relatively quickly

### Improvements to be made
- Though playtesters enjoyed the visuals, I would want to encorporate more 3D into the UI and some events
- To resolve some of the initial worldbuilding confusion of the players, I would want to maybe have a prologue or tutorial of sorts
- From the live playtest, I really noticed that I needed to scale the takes up a bit more. The resources depleted for too slowly

## Questions for playtesters - Round 2

1. Is the objective of the game clearly demonstrated?
2. The narrative is more fully-fledged now. Do you think that the world is immersive enough? Or do I need to add more?
3. Did the new sound effects work well? Are the randomly-ringing bell chimes too distracting?
4. Do there need to be more consequences? I feel that it still may be too narrative-heavy.
5. Were there any bugs with the UI? I was having an issue or two.
6. *Unrelated:* Would you like to write a dialogue interaction? I’ll put it in the game if you send me one.

## Results from playtesting - Round 2

### Main issues
- Choices aren't impactful upon gameplay
- No proper "endings"
- No narrative resolution for the _Raggedy protesters_ interaction
- Resources can't be used to any effect
- Could be more hints to specific important happenings in the world
- Sound effects to be a bit more meaningful and more muffled

### Main enjoyments
- Sound effects are soothing
- Objective is clear

### Improvements to be made
- Add a recurring character?
- Add a robber character?
- More sound effects
- Add a dialogue with an option to adopt a pet?
